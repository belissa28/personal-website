# Belissa's-personal-website
Hi there, so happy you're here!

My name is Belissa and I enjoy creating, designing and developing. I have experience as a software engineer and wanted to code my own website. I'll state how to run this website in case you're interested!
Just like how homemade meals are the best ones (in my humble opinion they are), I wanted to design and develop my own website from scratch.
Enjoy learning more about me as this website is also trying to showcase Belissa: the person behind the Software Engineering title.

Thanks for stopping by,

Belissa

To run this, simply git clone and run the command "npm start".
