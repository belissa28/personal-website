# personal-website
Hi there, so happy you're here!

My name is Belissa and I enjoy creating, designing and developing. I have experience as a software engineer and wanted to code my own website.
Just like how homemade meals are the best ones (in my humble opinion they are), I wanted to design and develop my own website from scratch.
Enjoy learning more about me as this website is also trying to showcase Belissa: the person behind the Software Engineering title.

Thanks for stopping by,
Belissa
