# Belissa's-personal-website
Hi there, so happy you're here!

My name is Belissa and I enjoy creating, designing and developing. I have experience as a software engineer and wanted to code my own website. 

Just like how homemade meals are the best ones (in my humble opinion they are), I wanted to design and develop my own website from scratch.
Enjoy learning more about me as this website is also trying to showcase Belissa: the person behind the Software Engineering title.


To run this code, simply git clone and run the command "npm start". 

Thanks for stopping by! You are now cooler than before : )

Best,
Belissa
